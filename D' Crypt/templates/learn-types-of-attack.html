        <h1>Types of Attack</h1>

        <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A cyberattack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization.
            Usually, the attacker seeks some type of benefit from disrupting the victimâ€™s network.</p>

        <p>Attacks can be classified under 2 categories:
            <ol>
                <li>Passive</li>
                <li>Active</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Passive Attacks</h2>
        <p>Passive attacks <b>do not</b> involve any modifications to the contents of an original message.
            The purpose is solely to gain information about the target without changing any data. The attack affects the confidentiality of information.</p>

        <p>Passive attacks are tough to detect as they do not involve any alteration of data, hence the sender and receiver will not suspect
        a third party of capturing the message.</p>

        <p>There are 2 types of passive attacks: </p>

        <div>
            <b class="attack-category rotate-oc" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#message-contents">1. Release of message contents <i class="fas fa-angle-down rotated" aria-hidden="true"></i></b>
            <p id="message-contents" class="collapse show">Recipient sends message to someone against sender's wish.
                <br><br>
                For example, Alice sends a sensitive document to Bob, who sends the document to Celia despite the fact
                that the document was confidential and not meant to be seen by others.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="attack-category rotate-oc" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#traffic-analysis">2. Traffic analysis <i class="fas fa-angle-down rotated" aria-hidden="true"></i></b>
            <div id="traffic-analysis" class="collapse show">
                <p>Attacker sniffs* the network to collect a range of information such as location & identity of communicating hosts, nature of communication etc.</p>
                <p class="font-italic small">*Sniffing is the electronic form of eavesdropping on the communications that computers transmit across the network.
                This can be done using packet analyzer tools such as Wireshark.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h2>Active Attacks</h2>
        <p>In contrast to passive attacks, active attacks involve modification to the contents of the original message.</p>

        <p>There are 3 sub-categories of active attacks:</p>

        <div>
            <b class="attack-category rotate-oc" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#fabrication">1. Fabrication <i class="fas fa-angle-down rotated" aria-hidden="true"></i></b>
            <p id="fabrication" class="collapse show">Fabrication attack affects the authenticity of the communication. The attacker inserts a fake message
            into the network, under the pretence that it was by an authorized user.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="attack-category rotate-oc" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#interruption">2. Interruption <i class="fas fa-angle-down rotated" aria-hidden="true"></i></b>
            <p id="interruption" class="collapse show">Interruption attack affects the availability of information/system. It involves the obstruction of communication
                between one or more systems.
                <br><br>
                For example, in a Denial of Service attack (DoS) the attacker sends several requests to the target server and
                overloads it with traffic. As the junk requests are processed constantly, the server becomes overwhelmed and hence delays
                responding to legitimate requests.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="attack-category rotate-oc" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#modification">3. Modification <i class="fas fa-angle-down rotated" aria-hidden="true"></i></b>
            <p id="modification" class="collapse show">Modification attack affects the integrity of a message. It means that some portion of a message is altered,
                 delayed or recorded to produce an unauthorised effect. Modification attacks can be divided into replay attacks and alterations.
                 <br><br>
                 Replay attacks happen when a hacker detects a secure network communication or data transmission, intercepts it,
                 and then retransmits it as if they were their own. For example, Alice sends Bob proof of her identity. Celia eavesdrop
                 on the conversation and keeps the proof of Alice identity. Celia subsequently requests to connect to Bob, posing as Alice
                 by sending him the intercepted proof from the previous session. Bob accepts and Celia is thus granted access.
                 <br><br>
                 Alteration is when a message is intercepted, modified and sent it to its destination.
